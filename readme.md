# Hatsune Miku

this project use [Unity 5.6.7f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive);

video and audio in this game i get from youtube. 
for downloading video from youtube i use [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) and to get mp3 from video i use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html).

the motivation of i created this game is to make alternative game like hatsune miku with my fav song,
and also to learn csharp.
